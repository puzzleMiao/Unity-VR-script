# c#-unity-vr-scripts
Includes the c# scripts that I write for unity VR projects which I learned and developed in UCLA MSAUD program 2022-2023.

**Do not copy the code in these projects directly. This repository is here for my personal reference and to showcase my development in programming over time.

Several of these scripts have frameworks created by Laure Michelon, the Lecturer at UCLA.

Several of these scripts have frameworks from Scrnalt's project
