# c#-unity-vr-scripts
Includes all the c# code that I used for unity VR projects which I learned and developed in UCLA MSAUD program 2022-2023.
This repository is here for my personal reference and to showcase my development in programming over time.

Several of these scripts have frameworks created by Laure Michelon, the lecturer at UCLA IDEAS Campus.
